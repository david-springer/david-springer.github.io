QUADRAT COMMUNICATIONS 
WEB FONT END-USER LICENCE AGREEMENT 

LICENCE: By using the web fonts (the "Web Fonts") provided by 
Quadrat Communications ("Quadrat"), you are agreeing to abide by 
the terms of this Licence Agreement (this "Licence") between you 
and Quadrat. You should read it carefully, as your agreement to 
its terms will be presumed. If you do not understand the terms of 
this Licence, you should review it with a lawyer. This Licence 
will be enforceable just like any written agreement signed by you. 
If you are not in agreement with terms of this Licence, you must 
immediately delete all of the Web Fonts from all Permitted 
Websites and Permitted Web-hosting Servers (as those two terms are 
defined below), and a full refund will be given. The other terms 
and conditions of this Licence are as follows: 

1.	Grant of Rights: Subject to the other terms and conditions 
of this Licence, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, 
non-transferable licence to use the Web Fonts and their supporting 
files and documentation for an indefinite period of time to create 
web pages on as many of the websites owned or maintained by you as 
your receipt, which must be attached hereto as Schedule "A", 
indicates that you have paid for ("Permitted Websites"), and to 
display those websites on the Internet. In the absence of a 
receipt being attached as Schedule "A", you will be deemed to have 
not paid for this Licence, and your use of the Web Fonts is 
strictly prohibited. 

2.	Ownership of Web Fonts: You do not own the Web Fonts. 
Ownership of the Web Fonts and all intellectual property rights 
relating thereto remains with Quadrat. You simply have permission 
to use them, subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence. 

3.	Web Hosting Servers: You may install the Web Fonts on any 
web hosting servers required to support the Permitted Websites 
("Permitted Web-hosting Servers"). 

4.	No Modifications: Any modification of the Web Fonts is 
expressly prohibited, and is a breach of this Licence, which will 
result in, among other things, the immediate termination of same. 

5.	No Embedding: Embedding of the Web Fonts in other documents 
is expressly prohibited. Any alterations to the Web Fonts to allow 
embedding is a breach of this Licence and will result in, among 
other things, the immediate termination of same. 

6.	No Reverse Engineering: You are prohibited from reverse 
engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise attempting 
to discover the source code of the Web Fonts. 

7.	Restriction on Copying: You are permitted to copy the Web 
Fonts only to the extent that copying occurs when you upload the 
Web Fonts to a web server. 

8.	Unauthorized Use: All rights not expressly granted to you in 
this Licence are expressly reserved to Quadrat, and any use of or 
access to the Web Fonts that is not expressly authorized by this 
Licence is a breach of this Licence, and Quadrat will be entitled 
to take immediate action to rectify such breach. 

9.	Licence and Web Fonts Not Assignable: This Licence is 
personal to you, and you may not assign or sublicense this Licence 
or any rights under this Licence, or otherwise transfer or 
distribute the Web Fonts, or any copy or modified form of any Web 
Fonts, to any other person or business unless such other person or 
business agrees to be bound by the terms of this Licence and you 
first delete all copies of the Web Fonts in your possession. You 
must advise Quadrat immediately of any such assignment. 

10.	No Use Without Payment: If Quadrat discovers that you are 
using the Web Fonts without remitting the appropriate payment for 
same, you will forthwith be required to remit the payment required 
for such use, at twice the then-current licence cost. 

11.	Termination: This Licence will terminate immediately upon 
any breach of the terms and conditions of same. Following any 
termination of this Licence, you must immediately delete all 
copies of the Web Fonts from all Permitted Websites and Permitted 
Web-hosting Servers and any other location in your possession or 
under your control. 

12.	Remedies for Breach of Licence: You hereby agree that 
monetary damages are insufficient to compensate Quadrat for any 
breach of this Licence. You agree that irreparable harm would 
accrue to Quadrat in the event of such breach. If this Licence is 
breached in any way, Quadrat will have the immediate right to seek 
an injunction to stop such breach, without prejudice to any other 
legal or equitable rights and remedies that it may have. 

13.	Intellectual Property Rights: The Web Fonts and any copies 
that you are authorized by Quadrat to make are the copyrighted 
material, intellectual property of and are owned exclusively by 
Quadrat throughout the world. The structure, organization and code 
of the Web Fonts are the valuable trade secrets, confidential and 
proprietary information of Quadrat. The Web Fonts are protected by 
copyright. You will not acquire any rights, express or implied, 
in the Web Fonts other than those expressly set out in this 
Licence. 

14.	Intellectual Property Notices: You may not delete or change 
any copyright or trademark notice that accompanies or is 
incorporated into the Web Fonts or their supporting files or 
documentation, and no other copyright or trademark notice may 
accompany or be incorporated into the Web Fonts, or any modified 
form of the Web Fonts, or in any related files or documentation. 

17.	Limitation of Liability: You agree to use the Web Fonts at 
your own risk. This software is provided on an "as is" basis. It 
is your responsibility to ensure that you have the proper hardware 
and safeguards in place to properly use the Web Fonts. Except as 
expressly set out elsewhere in this Licence, there are no express 
or implied representations, warranties or conditions of any kind 
in respect of the Web Fonts or the services provided by Quadrat. 
Further, Quadrat will not be liable to you or any other person or 
business for any indirect, special or consequential damages 
related to this Licence. Quadrat's entire liability under this 
Licence for damages from any cause whatsoever, at law or by 
statute, regardless of the form or cause of action, will not 
exceed the total amount actually paid by you to Quadrat pursuant 
to this Licence in the six (6) months immediately prior to your 
damages or loss. 

18.	Currency: Unless otherwise stated, all dollar amounts 
referred to in this Agreement are in lawful Canadian currency. 

19.	Taxes: In addition to the fees payable for the Web Fonts 
set out elsewhere on this website, you will pay to Quadrat all 
taxes payable by you pursuant to this Licence. 

20.	Infringement Indemnity: You will defend and indemnify 
Quadrat with respect to all damages, costs, fees, judgments and 
other expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) 
incurred by Quadrat arising from any breach by you of this 
Licence, provided that Quadrat must notify you in writing within 
thirty (30) days of any such claim. 

21.	Force Majeure: Quadrat will not be liable for any delay or 
failure to perform under this Licence if such delay or failure is 
due to any event or situation beyond its reasonable control, 
including but not limited to war, explosion, fire, flood, 
earthquake, epidemic, act of civil or military authorities, labour 
dispute or civil disturbance. 

22.	Relationship of Parties: You and Quadrat are independent 
contractors. Nothing in this Licence will be construed to place 
us in a relationship of principal and agent, employer and 
employee, partners, associates, affiliates or joint venturers, and 
neither of us will have the power to obligate or bind the other in 
any manner whatsoever. 

23.	Governing Law: This Licence and all matters relating to 
same will be governed in accordance with the laws of the Province 
of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, regardless 
of where you reside, work or carry on business, or where the Web 
Fonts are used, stored or displayed. Any dispute or matter arising 
from this Licence or your use of the Web Fonts will be determined 
in the courts of the City of Toronto, Province of Ontario. 

24.	Severability: If any provision of this Licence is 
determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable, it will be 
severed from the remaining agreement. The remaining provisions of 
this License will continue in full force and effect. 

25.	Waiver: No waiver by either party of any term or provision 
of this Licence, whether express or implied, will constitute a 
continuing waiver of such term or provision, or a waiver of any 
other term of this Agreement.

agreement between the parties regarding the Web Fonts. No 
collateral warranty or agreement, or previous agreement of any
